# Blog Website
A dynamic blog website built using the following:

- Front-end: Bootstrap
- Back-end: Node.js with Express.js
- Cloud database: MongoDB Atlas
- Cloud image storage: Cloudinary
- Cloud host: Render

The project was initialy built as part of The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu. 

#### Functionality added by me:
- Connected the database to cloud using MongoDB Atlas
- Formatted home and post pages to include image, date and username for posts
- Made web app responsive
- Image upload (to cloud) facility for each post
- User registration, login and authentication
- Formatted about and contact pages
- Added a seperate page to view all posts in the order of newest first
- Added option to delete a post
- Deployed the web app to Render
