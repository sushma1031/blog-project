# Blog Website
A dynamic blog website initially built as part of The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu. I'm working on adding further functionality.

What I have added so far:
- Connected the database to cloud using MongoDB Atlas
- Formatted home and post pages to include image, date and username for posts
- Made web app responsive
- Deployed the web app to Render


What I want to add:
- User login and authentication
- Image upload facility
- Tags and post filtering
